## Reference File for NMODL Tests

A repository filled with C++ files created form MOD files contained in
the NMODL repository. Every update to NMODL causes these files to be updated.
This is useful to browse the generated files, e.g. while reviewing a PR or
just as a convenient way of quickly checking and linkin to the code produced
by `nmodl`.

## License

For license details, see LICENSE.txt. Note that this repository contains code
auto-generated by MOD file translators from the NMODL and NEURON projects.
Therefore, it is additionally subject to the license terms specified by those tools.
